								<h1>NEW CAKES FOR SUMMER</h1>
								<span>By Admin on November 28, 2023</span>
								<p>I baked my first homemade cake when I was eleven. It was supposed to be a simple vanilla sponge, but I remember mixing the batter way too much and ending up with something closer to a brick than a cake. Still, it smelled good, and that was enough for me to keep going.

A lot has changed since that day. I’ve learned how to balance sweetness, how long butter really takes to soften, and why you should never rush a cooling cake unless you enjoy watching the frosting melt off the sides. Now I experiment with new flavors whenever I can. Some work. Some don’t. All teach me something.

My favorite part of baking is sharing the result. When someone enjoys a slice, it feels worth the time spent measuring, mixing, checking, adjusting, and sometimes starting over. Baking is slow and a little messy, but that’s what makes it fun.

This website is just a small place to share my passion, track what I’m learning, and maybe inspire someone else to try baking a cake at home. If you’re curious about homemade cakes, you’re in the right place.</p>
